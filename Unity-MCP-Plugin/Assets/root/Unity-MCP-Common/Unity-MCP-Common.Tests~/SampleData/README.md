# SampleData

This folder contains intentionally small, single-purpose classes used by tests and experiments to cover a variety of language shapes:

- Methods: different argument counts, return types (void, primitives, generic, async Task/Task of T).
- Properties: various access modifiers (public, protected, internal, protected internal, private protected) and patterns (private setter, init-only).
- Fields: access modifiers plus static, readonly, const variations.

Each class represents one case to keep discovery simple and unambiguous.
