## Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Project path cannot contain spaces**
>
> - ✅ `C:/MyProjects/Project`
> - ❌ `C:/My Projects/Project`

### Install `MCP Client`

Choose `MCP Client` you prefer, don't need to install all of them. This is will be your main chat window to talk with LLM.

- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
- [GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
- [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com)
- Any other supported

> MCP protocol is quite universal, that is why you may any MCP client you prefer, it will work as smooth as anyone else. The only important thing, that the MCP client has to support dynamic tool update.

# Installation

## Step 1: Install `Unity Plugin`

- **[⬇️ Download Installer](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP/releases/download/0.16.2/AI-Game-Dev-Installer.unitypackage)**
- **📂 Import installer into Unity project**
  > - You may use double click on the file - Unity will open it
  > - OR: You may open Unity Editor first, then click on `Assets/Import Package/Custom Package`, then choose the file

<details>
  <summary><b>Alternative: Install <code>Unity Plugin</code> via OpenUPM</b></summary>

- [Install OpenUPM-CLI](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli#installation)
- Open command line in Unity project folder
- Run the command

```bash
openupm add com.ivanmurzak.unity.mcp
```

</details>

## Step 2: Configure `MCP Client`

### Automatic configuration

- Open Unity project
- Open `Window/AI Connector (Unity-MCP)`
- Click `Configure` at your MCP client

![Unity_AI](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP/blob/main/docs/img/ai-connector-window.gif)

> If MCP client is not in the list, use the raw JSON below in the window, to inject it into your MCP client. Read instructions for your MCP client how to do that.

### Manual configuration

If Automatic configuration doesn't work for you for any reason.

Use JSON from `AI Connector (Unity-MCP)` window to configure any `MCP Client` on your own.

# Use AI

Talk with AI (LLM) in your `MCP Client`. Ask it to do anything you want. As better you describe your task / idea - as better it will do the job.

Some `MCP Clients` allow to chose different LLM models. Take an eye on it, some model may work much better.

  ```text
  Explain my scene hierarchy
  ```

  ```text
  Create 3 cubes in a circle with radius 2
  ```

  ```text
  Create metallic golden material and attach it to a sphere gameObject
  ```

> Make sure `Agent` mode is turned on in MCP client

# How it works

**[Unity-MCP](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP)** is a bridge between LLM and Unity. It exposes and explains to LLM Unity's tools. LLM understands the interface and utilizes the tools in the way a user asks.

Connect **[Unity-MCP](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP)** to LLM client such as [Claude](https://claude.ai/download) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) using integrated `AI Connector` window. Custom clients are supported as well.

The project is designed to let developers to add custom tools soon. After that the next goal is to enable the same features in player's build. For not it works only in Unity Editor.

The system is extensible: you can define custom `tool`s directly in your Unity project codebase, exposing new capabilities to the AI or automation clients. This makes Unity-MCP a flexible foundation for building advanced workflows, rapid prototyping, or integrating AI-driven features into your development process.

# Advanced MCP server setup

Unity-MCP server supports many different launch options and docker docker deployment. Both transport protocol are supported `http` and `stdio`. [Read more...](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP/blob/main/docs/mcp-server.md)

# Add custom `tool`

> ⚠️ It only works with MCP client that supports dynamic tool list update.

Unity-MCP is designed to support custom `tool` development by project owner. MCP server takes data from Unity plugin and exposes it to a Client. So anyone in the MCP communication chain would receive the information about a new `tool`. Which LLM may decide to call at some point.

To add a custom `tool` you need:

1. To have a class with attribute `McpPluginToolType`.
2. To have a method in the class with attribute `McpPluginTool`.
3. [optional] Add `Description` attribute to each method argument to let LLM to understand it.
4. [optional] Use `string? optional = null` properties with `?` and default value to mark them as `optional` for LLM.

> Take a look that the line `MainThread.Instance.Run(() =>` it allows to run the code in Main thread which is needed to interact with Unity API. If you don't need it and running the tool in background thread is fine for the tool, don't use Main thread for efficiency purpose.

```csharp
[McpPluginToolType]
public class Tool_GameObject
{
    [McpPluginTool
    (
        "MyCustomTask",
        Title = "Create a new GameObject"
    )]
    [Description("Explain here to LLM what is this, when it should be called.")]
    public string CustomTask
    (
        [Description("Explain to LLM what is this.")]
        string inputData
    )
    {
        // do anything in background thread

        return MainThread.Instance.Run(() =>
        {
            // do something in main thread if needed

            return $"[Success] Operation completed.";
        });
    }
}
```

# Add custom in-game `tool`

> ⚠️ Not yet supported. The work is in progress
