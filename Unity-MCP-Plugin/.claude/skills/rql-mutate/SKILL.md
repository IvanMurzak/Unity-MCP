# RQL / Mutate

Change the live Unity Editor scene with an RQL query whose last stage is set or call. All-or-nothing: every target and value is checked before anything is written; a failure changes nothing. Undoable in the Editor (Ctrl+Z). Changed assets, scenes and the open prefab are saved to disk automatically; an untitled scene needs SaveAs(path). dry_run=true returns the receipt ($ref, member, old, new) without changing anything. Do exactly the change requested; a read-only member fails with readonly-member instead of being approximated.
  set path = expr, ...   assign members (paths may go through structs: set transform.position.y = transform.position.y + 1)
  call Method(args)      invoke a method the tools expose
Examples:
  objects | where name == "Player" | set transform.position = "(0, 1, 0)"
  objects | get components | where $ is Light | set intensity = intensity * 2, color = "#ffcc88"
  objects | where tag == "Enemy" | set active = false
  unity.asset("Assets/Mats/Red.mat") | set properties["_Color"] = "(1, 0, 0, 1)"
  objects | where name == "Spawner" | set targets = append(targets, ref("GameObject#1234"))
Create / add / remove (call; the receipt's result column holds the new object's $ref for follow-up queries):
  editor | call CreateGameObject("Props")                                   new root GameObject
  editor | call CreateGameObject("Crate", ref("GameObject#1234"), "Cube")    child of a parent, optional primitive
  objects | where name == "Crate" | call AddComponent("Rigidbody")           add a component by type name
  objects | where name == "Old" | call Destroy()                             remove a GameObject (components: get components | where $ is X | call Destroy())
  objects | where name == "Lamp" | set transform.parent = ref("GameObject#1234")   reparent (keeps the world position)
  objects | where name == "Crate" | call Duplicate()                          copy next to it (returns the copy)
Scenes, prefabs, assets, Editor state:
  editor | call OpenScene("Assets/Scenes/Level.unity")          editor | call NewScene("Assets/Scenes/New.unity")
  scenes | where path == "" | call SaveAs("Assets/Scenes/New.unity")   scenes | where name == "Level" | call SetActive()
  editor | call InstantiatePrefab("Assets/Prefabs/Enemy.prefab", ref("GameObject#1234"), "(0, 0, 5)")
  objects | where name == "Crate" | call SaveAsPrefab("Assets/Prefabs/Crate.prefab")
  editor | call OpenPrefab("Assets/Prefabs/Enemy.prefab")  then  prefab | recurse children | …  then  editor | call ClosePrefab()
  editor | call CreateMaterial("Assets/Mats/Glow.mat")        editor | call MoveAsset("Assets/A.mat", "Assets/Mats/A.mat")
  editor | set selection = [ref("GameObject#1234")]         editor | set isPlaying = true
Object literals build values: set settings = {speed: 2, "$type": "FastSettings"}. At most 20 targets per call.

Query syntax:
RQL: source | stage | stage ...
Sources: objects (every GameObject in the loaded scenes, inactive included), roots, scenes, selection, prefab (the prefab open in prefab editing mode), console (Editor log entries), shaders, componentTypes, editor (Editor state and operations). Assets: unity.assets("t:Material") or unity.assets("t:Prefab", "Assets/Enemies"), unity.asset("Assets/Mats/Red.mat"). ref("Light#1234") resolves a $ref; unity.find("Player") or unity.find("Level/Pillar_1") a GameObject by unique name or path.
Stages:
  where <predicate>                  filter
  select a b.c alias=(expr)          project columns (wrap computed expressions in parentheses)
  sort <expr> [desc], ...            stable sort
  first N | skip N | count
  get <path>                         replace each item by a member (lists are flattened)
  recurse children [max-depth=N] [include-self=false]   walk the hierarchy (input items included by default)
  distinct [expr] | group-by expr | sum expr | min expr | max expr | avg expr
Expressions: == != < <= > >= and or not + - * / %; contains, starts-with, ends-with (case-insensitive); matches "regex"; x in [a, b]; x is null; x is not null; $ is Light (includes subclasses); has(member). Literals: numbers, "strings", true/false/null, lists [a, b], objects {x: 1, y: 2}.
Paths: a.b.c, list[0], map["key"]; .member on a list maps over its elements. List methods: .any(pred) .all(pred) .count([pred]) .sum(e) .min(e) .max(e) .first([pred]); inside them bare names refer to the element, falling back to the outer item.
Meta: $ (current item), $ref (stable id such as Light#1234), $type, $path, $index, $depth. Enums compare to strings (type == "Spot"); == on strings is case-sensitive.
Unity: GameObject has components (list), children (list), active, name, tag, layer, transform (position, localPosition, eulerAngles, localScale, parent). Component members are the C# members (public + [SerializeField]); find them via objects | get components | where $ is Light. Vectors/colors print as (x, y, z); write "(1, 2, 3)", [1, 2, 3] or {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}; colors also "#ff8800". Material shader properties: properties["_Color"]. Destroyed objects read as null (missing references: where target == null). Navigate with paths or get; select only projects output columns.
Results come back as compact rows (header line, then col|col). Long results are truncated — refine with where/first or use count. Unknown members produce warnings with suggestions; rql-schema(type) lists a type's members.

## How to Call

```bash
unity-mcp-cli run-tool rql-mutate --input '{
  "query": "string_value",
  "dry_run": false
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use:
> ```bash
> unity-mcp-cli run-tool rql-mutate --input-file args.json
> ```
>
> Or pipe via stdin (recommended):
> ```bash
> unity-mcp-cli run-tool rql-mutate --input-file - <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```


### Troubleshooting

If `unity-mcp-cli` is not found, either install it globally (`npm install -g unity-mcp-cli`) or use `npx unity-mcp-cli` instead.
Read the /unity-initial-setup skill for detailed installation instructions.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | `string` | Yes | RQL query ending with a set or call stage, e.g. objects | where name == "Player" | set active = false |
| `dry_run` | `boolean` | No | true = preview the receipt without changing anything |

### Input JSON Schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "query": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "dry_run": {
      "type": "boolean"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "query"
  ]
}
```
