# Getting Started with Unity-MCP

Welcome to Unity-MCP! This guide will help you set up and start using AI assistance in your Unity projects in just a few minutes.

## üéØ What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- Unity-MCP Plugin installed in Unity Editor
- MCP Server running and connected
- AI client configured and ready to use
- Your first AI-assisted Unity task completed

## ‚ö° Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites

- **Unity 2022.3+** (LTS recommended)
- **Claude Desktop App** or **VS Code with MCP extension**
- **Docker** (recommended) or **.NET 8.0+**

### Step 1: Install Unity Plugin

Choose one of these installation methods:

#### Option A: Unity Asset Store (Easiest)
1. Open Unity Editor
2. Go to **Window ‚Üí Asset Store**
3. Search for "Unity MCP"
4. Click **Download** and **Import**

#### Option B: OpenUPM (Recommended for developers)
1. Open Unity Editor
2. Go to **Window ‚Üí Package Manager**
3. Click **"+" ‚Üí Add package from git URL**
4. Enter: `https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP.git?path=/Unity-MCP-Plugin/Assets/root`

#### Option C: Git URL
1. In Package Manager, click **"+" ‚Üí Add package from git URL**
2. Enter: `https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP.git?path=/Unity-MCP-Plugin/Assets/root`

### Step 2: Launch MCP Server

#### Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 ivanmurzakdev/unity-mcp-server:latest
```

#### Using .NET Tool
```bash
dotnet tool install -g Unity.MCP.Server
unity-mcp-server
```

### Step 3: Configure AI Client

#### For Claude Desktop
1. Open Claude Desktop settings
2. Add MCP server configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-p", "8080:8080", "ivanmurzakdev/unity-mcp-server:latest"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### For VS Code
1. Install the MCP extension
2. Configure the Unity-MCP server endpoint: `http://localhost:8080`

### Step 4: Test Your Setup

1. **Open Unity Editor** with any project
2. **Start your AI client** (Claude Desktop or VS Code)
3. **Ask the AI**: "Can you create a red cube in the Unity scene?"
4. **Watch the magic happen!** ‚ú®

## üéÆ Your First AI Tasks

Once everything is connected, try these beginner-friendly tasks:

### Create Basic Objects
```
"Create a blue sphere at position (0, 5, 0)"
"Add a directional light to the scene"
"Create a plane as the ground"
```

### Modify Existing Objects
```
"Make the Main Camera look at the cube"
"Change the cube's material to metallic"
"Add a Rigidbody to the sphere so it falls"
```

### Scene Organization
```
"Create an empty GameObject called 'Environment'"
"Move all terrain objects under the Environment parent"
"Organize the scene hierarchy"
```

## üîß Basic Configuration

After installation, Unity-MCP works with default settings, but you might want to customize:

### Unity Plugin Settings
1. Go to **Window ‚Üí Unity MCP ‚Üí Settings**
2. Configure:
   - **Server Port**: 8080 (default)
   - **Auto-connect**: Enable for automatic connection
   - **Connection Timeout**: 10 seconds (default)

### Server Configuration
The server accepts several environment variables:
- `UNITY_MCP_PORT=8080` - Connection port
- `UNITY_MCP_CLIENT_TRANSPORT=http` - Transport protocol
- `UNITY_MCP_PLUGIN_TIMEOUT=10000` - Plugin timeout in milliseconds
