# Project structure

`AI Game Developer` contains multiple different project and work as collaboration of multiple system working together. Here is the main structure of the project:

```mermaid
graph LR

  A(MCP-Client)
  B(Unity-MCP-Server)
  C(Unity-MCP-Plugin)

  %% Relationships
  A <--> B
  B <--> C

```

`Unity-MCP-Server` and `Unity-MCP-Plugin` are written with C# and they both use SignalR to communicate.

```mermaid

  A(Unity-MCP-Server)
  B(Unity-MCP-Plugin)
  C(Unity-MCP-Common)

  %% Relationships
  A --> C
  B --> C

```

- `Unity-MCP-Server`
- `Unity-MCP-Plugin`
- `Unity-MCP-Common`
- `Installer`


```csharp
[McpPluginToolType]
public class Tool_GameObject
{
    [McpPluginTool
    (
        "MyCustomTask",
        Title = "Create a new GameObject"
    )]
    [Description("Explain here to LLM what is this, when it should be called.")]
    public string CustomTask
    (
        [Description("Explain to LLM what is this.")]
        string inputData
    )
    {
        // do anything in background thread

        return MainThread.Instance.Run(() =>
        {
            // do something in main thread if needed

            return $"[Success] Operation completed.";
        });
    }
}
```

## Add custom `MCP Prompt`

`MCP Prompt` allows you to inject custom prompts into the conversation with the LLM. It supports two sender roles: User and Assistant. This is a quick way to instruct the LLM to perform specific tasks. You can generate prompts using custom data, providing lists or any other relevant information.

```csharp
[McpPluginPromptType]
public static class Prompt_ScriptingCode
{
    [McpPluginPrompt(Name = "add-event-system", Role = Role.User)]
    [Description("Implement UnityEvent-based communication system between GameObjects.")]
    public string AddEventSystem()
    {
        return "Create event system using UnityEvents, UnityActions, or custom event delegates for decoupled communication between game systems and components.";
    }
}
```

# Runtime usage (in-game)

Use **[Unity MCP](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP)** in your game/app. Use Tools, Resources or Prompts. By default there are no tools, you would need to implement your custom.

```csharp
UnityMcpPlugin.BuildAndStart(); // Build and start Unity-MCP-Plugin, it is required
UnityMcpPlugin.Connect(); // Start active connection with retry to Unity-MCP-Server
UnityMcpPlugin.Disconnect(); // Stop active connection and close existed connection
```

## Sample: AI powered Chess game bot

There is a classic Chess game. Lets outsource to LLM the bot logic. Bot should do the turn using game rules.

```csharp
[McpPluginToolType]
public static class ChessGameAI
{
    [McpPluginTool("chess-do-turn", Title = "Do the turn")]
    [Description("Do the turn in the chess game. Returns true if the turn was accepted, false otherwise.")]
    public static Task<bool> DoTurn(int figureId, Vector2Int position)
    {
        return MainThread.Instance.RunAsync(() => ChessGameController.Instance.DoTurn(figureId, position));
    }

    [McpPluginTool("chess-get-board", Title = "Get the board")]
    [Description("Get the current state of the chess board.")]
    public static Task<BoardData> GetBoard()
    {
        return MainThread.Instance.RunAsync(() => ChessGameController.Instance.GetBoardData());
    }
}
```
